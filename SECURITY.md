## Reporting a Vulnerability
### Report process

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in Zero-TOTP, please report it to us by emailing developer@zero-totp.com. We ask that you do not report security vulnerabilities directly on GitHub, public forums, or any other public channel.

**Please, encrypt all the sensitve information with the following [PGP key](https://keybase.io/devnath)**

### Vulnerability evaluation
We evaluate reported vulnerabilities based on the following criteria:
1. Impact: The severity and potential impact of the vulnerability.
2. Likelihood: The likelihood of the vulnerability being exploited.
3. Complexity: The complexity of exploiting the vulnerability.

You can use a [CVSS 3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) to evaluate the criticity of your findings. All findings with a CVSS score below 3 will not be necessarily treated and/or with an increased delay. 
Of course, most critical vulnerabilities will be treated before everything else, while the investigation is done.
